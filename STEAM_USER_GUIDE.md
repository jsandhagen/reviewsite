# Steam Integration - User Guide

## How to Link Your Steam Profile

1. **Navigate to Your Profile Page**
   - Log into your account
   - Click on your username or profile picture in the top right
   - You'll see a "Steam Integration" section

2. **Get Your Steam Profile URL**
   Your Steam profile URL can be in several formats:
   - Custom URL: `https://steamcommunity.com/id/yourname`
   - Numeric ID: `https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000000000`
   - Direct ID: Just the number `76561198000000000`

3. **Link Your Profile**
   - Paste your Steam profile URL into the input field
   - Click "Link Steam Profile"
   - Wait for the import to complete (may take a few minutes for large libraries)

4. **Important: Make Your Profile Public**
   For the integration to work, your Steam profile must be public:
   - Go to Steam Settings → Privacy Settings
   - Set "My profile" to Public
   - Set "Game details" to Public

## What Happens When You Link Steam?

1. **All your owned games are imported** into your backlog
2. **Games are sorted by playtime** - most played games appear first
3. **Playtime is recorded** for each game in hours
4. **New games are added** to the database with full details:
   - Name
   - Description
   - Genres
   - Release date
   - Price
   - Steam App ID

## Re-importing Games

If you purchase new games on Steam:
1. Go to your profile page
2. Click "Re-import Games from Steam"
3. New games will be added to your backlog

## Managing Your Backlog

After importing from Steam:
- View all games in the **Backlog** page
- Drag and drop to reorder games manually
- Type a new rank number to quickly reposition a game
- Click "Add Review" to rate a game (moves it out of backlog)
- Click "Remove" to take a game out of your backlog

## Unlinking Steam

To unlink your Steam profile:
1. Go to your profile page
2. Click "Unlink Steam"
3. Note: This only removes the link, imported games remain in your backlog

## Tips

- **Large libraries take time**: If you have 500+ games, import may take 5-10 minutes
- **Rate limiting**: The import respects Steam's API rate limits
- **Duplicates are avoided**: Games already in your backlog won't be duplicated
- **Community scores**: See what other users think before playing!
